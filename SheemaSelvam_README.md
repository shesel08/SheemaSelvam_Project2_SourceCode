## Clue/Cluedo: The Classic Mystery Game
The object of the game is to determine who murdered the game's victim, where the crime took place, and which weapon was used.
Each player assumes the role of one of the six suspects and attempts to deduce the correct answer by strategically moving around a game board representing the rooms of a mansion and collecting clues about the circumstances of the murder from the other players.
The game consists of a board which shows the rooms, corridors, and secret passages of an English country house called Tudor Mansion/Boddy Mansion.
The game box also includes several coloured playing pieces to represent characters, miniature murder weapon props, two six-sided dice, three sets of cards (describing the aforementioned rooms, characters, or weapons), Solution Cards and an envelope (or a mirror in some editions) to contain one card from each set of cards and a Detective's Notes pad on which are printed lists of rooms, weapons, and characters, so players can keep detailed notes during the game.
The murder victim in the game was known as Mr. Boddy in North American versions.

The six suspects are:
* Miss. Scarlett
* Colonel. Mustard
* Mrs. White
* Reverend. Green
* Mrs. Peacock
* Professor. Plum

The weapons are:
* Candlestick
* Knife
* Lead pipe
* Revolver
* Rope
* Wrench

There are nine rooms in the mansion where the murder could have taken place. 
* Hall
* Lounge
* Dining room
* Kitchen
* Ballroom
* Conservatory
* Billiard room
* Library
* Study

The players involved are bots, and they make random decisions based on the weightage provided for each decision. The game starts with 3 assumed players Alice, Bob and Charlie.
The murder solution with suspect, weapon and room are separated first and removed from the deck. The remaining cards are shuffled and distributed.
